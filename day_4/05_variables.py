# pros:
# 1. it reduce the human efforts for coding
# 2. easy to to write for long datasets
# 3. easy to recall

# strategy
# 1. Only those jo python ki apni zuban main nahi he
    # and
    # as
    # assert
    # async
    # await
#     # break 
#     so on and so forth
# 2. dont ever write variable names with space intead use _
# 3. capitalize na Karen 
# 4. always use short words (max 2) e.g.: samosa_kimaa
# 5. special charecter na use karen ?, @, # etc
# 6. Don't use numbers in variables at the beginning
# 7. meaningful
# 8. global trends (df = dataframe)
# 9. Don't ever repeat the same variable (pehlewala overwrite ho jana he )
# 10. Operators use nahi karnay he(+, - , * /)


# x = 2+3+9-9*12(2/3) # it will show error

# fruit_basket = ("Apple","Banana", "Orange","Pineapple","pear","Peach","Mango")

# print('fruit_basket') # it will print it as string  not list
# print(fruit_basket)    # this is correct way to print list
# print(samosa)
# print(x1)
# print(type(x1))
# print(type(samosa))
# print(type(fruit_basket))
# print(type(name_2))
